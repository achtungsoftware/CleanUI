# What is CleanUI
CleanUI is a SwiftUI & Swift, ui / backend framework. CleanUI has everything build in to get you started to build your app. CleanUI is ripped out of the [Knoggl iOS App](https://www.knoggl.com) to make a reusable framework, which can be worked on without directly changing things inside of the [Knoggl iOS App](https://www.knoggl.com). In other words, CleanUI is the heart of the [Knoggl iOS App](https://www.knoggl.com).

# What's inside
CleanUI has many default views from simple to complex. CleanUI allows to make huge changes in your app with little code as possible. Besides that, CleanUI contains many swift extension and helper classes (for example for networking or video processing).

# How to use
CleanUI views have a 'CL' prefix. CleanUI helper classes have a 'CU' prefix.

# CleanUI Demo
The CleanUI Demo is far from complete and is currently used for testing.

# Package Managers
CleanUI is currently not available on any package managers. If you want to use it, you have to build it by yourself.

# Building
Build the XCFramework with

```console
sh build.sh
```
