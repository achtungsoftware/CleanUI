# What is CleanUI
CleanUI is a SwiftUI / iOS framwork. CleanUI has many things build in to get you started to build your app. CleanUI is ripped out of the [Knoggl iOS App](https://www.knoggl.com) to make a reusable framework, which can be worked on without directly changing things inside of the [Knoggl iOS App](https://www.knoggl.com). In other words, CleanUI is the heart of the [Knoggl iOS App](https://www.knoggl.com).

# What's inside
CleanUI has many default views from simple to complex. CleanUI allows to make huge changes in your app with little code as possible.

# How to use
CleanUI views have a 'CL' prefix. CleanUI helper classes have a 'CU' prefix.
